# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building AI-powered applications, cloud infrastructure, and scalable full-stack solutions. Currently working as a Thrive Software Engineering Apprentice at Verizon, where I've had the opportunity to work on impactful projects that drive innovation and efficiency.

## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with expertise in modern web technologies, cloud infrastructure, and AI/ML applications. I love working with cutting-edge technologies and solving complex problems that make a real impact.

## Why I Do What I Do

My passion for technology stems from a desire to create solutions that improve people's lives and streamline business operations. I understand the importance of reliability, security, and efficiency in mission-critical systems. This drives me to build robust, scalable applications that can handle real-world challenges.

## Areas of Interest

- **AI/ML Integration**: Leveraging LangChain, LangGraph, and modern LLMs to build intelligent applications
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Designing and deploying scalable solutions on AWS and GCP
- **Full-Stack Development**: Creating seamless user experiences with modern frameworks
- **DevOps & Automation**: Streamlining development workflows and deployment processes
- **Security & Compliance**: Implementing secure, compliant solutions for enterprise environments

## Apprenticeship Experience

### Verizon - Thrive Software Engineering Apprentice

_August 2024 - Present | Basking Ridge, NJ_

I'm currently part of Verizon's Network and Security team, collaborating with cross-functional teams including DevOps and Analytics to deliver enterprise-level solutions.

#### Teams I've Worked With

- **Network and Security Team**: Core development and security implementation
- **DevOps Team**: Infrastructure automation and deployment optimization

#### Impact at Verizon

**Test Automation**: Designed and executed a comprehensive test automation framework for a distributed analytics environment using Playwright. This resulted in over 200 E2E tests across UI, APIs, and data visualizations, leading to a 90% reduction in manual regression testing and significantly improved deployment confidence.

**Security & Compliance**: Managed the end-to-end vulnerability management lifecycle for critical projects, protecting applications from numerous threats. Ensured continuous ISO 27001 compliance by integrating SAST (Fortify), SCA (BlackDuck), and container security (Sysdig) scanning, reducing security vulnerabilities by 85%.

**AI/ML**: Developed an AI utility using Python, LangChain, and AWS to parse and summarize complex Terraform plans. This significantly improved clarity and reduced review time for non-technical operations teams by 70%, enabling faster infrastructure deployments.
